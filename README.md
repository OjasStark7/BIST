# BIST
In this project, I have implemented a Built In Self Test (BIST) using a modular Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) as Test Pattern Generator (TPG), a Circuit Under Test (CUT) and a Single Input Shift Register (SISR) as Output Response Analyzer (ORA). The BIST is used to test the circuit and give the final signature as the output.

The characteristic polynomial used for the LFSR & the SISR is: Î¦(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1 & the circuit used as the CUT is f = a.b + c.d.

The LFSR first generates the output pattern Q0-Q3 using the seed 0001, these values are then fed a,b,c,d as Q0-Q3 are connected to a-d. Hence, we get a sequence value for f, which is 0111000. Now, this f is fed as the input m(t) to the SISR and we get the final output value of the signature as 0100. Only 8 cycles are used to get the signature as the characteristic polynomial I used is not a primitive polynomial and starting from the 8th cycle of the clock, the values are repeated and so we can get the output signature at the 8th cycle only.

Further information on how the bist works and how these values are calculated can be seen in the bist_notes.pdf where i have written the complete question on which basis I have made this BIST and also the details of its working process.
